Starting to solve the system of equation...
  2x +   4y =  10
  7x +   1y =   9
Calculating the determinant as:
| cx1   cy1 |
|           |    = ( cx1*cy2 - cx2*cy1 )
| cx2   cy2 |
             
|  2      4|
|          |   = -26
|  7      1|

In the above equation the determinant is -26
Next we calculate the determinant after column substitution.
First replace the X column with RHS
| rhs1   cy1 |
|           |    = ( rhs1*cy2 - rhs2*cy1 )
| rhs2   cy2 |
             
| 10      4|
|          |   = -26
|  9      1|

Then divide this determinant by the coefficient determinant -26
Therefore X = -26 / -26 = 1
Next we calculate the determinant after column substitution.
First replace the Y column with RHS
| cx1   rhs1 |
|           |    = ( cx1*rhs2 - cx2*rhs1 )
| cx2   rhs2 |
             
|  2     10|
|          |   = -52
|  7      9|

Then divide this determinant by the coefficient determinant -26
Therefore Y = -52 / -26 = 2
Solution is X = 1 Y = 2
